"""




Both 1 and 2 are solved using Dijkstra's algorithm which has a co,plexity of O(V+ElogV)
Hence the complexity for N places and M roads will be O(N+MlogN)




If the number of titans in each road is 1 then we can use BFS
algorithm and give and adjacency list and the source as its inputs so it wil have
a complexity of O(N+M)
