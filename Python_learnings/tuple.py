# Tuple is an unchangeable data type with multiple items where only count can be used and we can access them 
# and check their index . They are written with 1st brackets 

# .count("what to count") returns the number of times of the occurence of  a specified item

# .index(" what to find" , start , end) returns the index of the specified item

# only way to edit a tuple is to add them with another tuple



abc = ( "meteor" , "comets")

xyz = ("star" , "planet" , "asteroids" , "moon" , "planet")

#print(xyz)

#print(xyz.count("planet"))

#print(xyz.index("planet" , 2 , ) )

#xyz += ("meteor", )
#print(xyz)

#xyz += abc

#print(xyz)
