#
# eval()   While taking input if we use eval then function then python will recognise the input and process it accordingly
# for example if we use eval(input())  and give the input as [1,2,3] then the input will be stored as list and not as a string
#
#
# If we map a list of str to int then in return we get a map object 
# If we map a single varible of string to int in return we get a int object

#
# ord("character")  to convert a character to ASCII
# chr("ASCII number") to convert a ASCII number to a character
